    "Behaviours are actions that an object can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The behaviours of an object are expressed as functions that are part of the class.\n",

    "### Hiding Details and Creating Public Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The key purpose of modelling an object in object-oriented design is to determine what the public interface of that object will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface is the collection of attributes and methods that other objects can access to interact with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common real-world example is the television. Our interface to the television is the remote control. Each button on the remote control represents a method that can be called on the television object. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we, as the calling object, access these methods, we do not know or care if the television is getting its signal from a cable connection, a satellite dish, or an internet-enabled device. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care what electronic signals are being sent to adjust the volume, or whether the sound is destined for speakers or headphones. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we open the television to access its internal workings, for example, to split the output signal to both external speakers and a set of headphones, we may void the warranty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of hiding the implementation of an object is called encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TV's external case encapsulates the state and behaviour of the television.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not have direct access to the wiring of the amplifier or the circuitry of the tuner.\n",
    "\n",
    " Abstraction means dealing with the level of detail that is most appropriate to a given task. It is the process of extracting a public interface from the inner details. A car's driver needs to interact with the steering, accelerator, and brakes. \n",
    " \n",
    "The workings of the motor, drive train, and brake subsystem don't matter to the driver. A mechanic, on the other hand, works at a different level of abstraction, tuning the engine and bleeding the brakes. "

    "Dictionaries are extremely versatile and have numerous uses. Here are two major examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-) We can have dictionaries where all the values are different instances of objects with the same type. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, our stock dictionary would have a type hint of `dict[str, tuple[float, float, float]]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The string key maps to a three-tuple of values. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the stock symbol as an index to price details. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we had a more complex Stock class, we might have a dictionary with `dict[str, Stock]` as the type hint for an index into these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2-)The second design is to have each key represent some aspect or attribute of a single object; the values often have distinct types. \n",
    "\n",
    "We may, for example, represent a stock with {'name': 'GOOG', 'current': 1245.21, 'range': (1252.64, 1245.18)}. \n",
    "\n",
    "This case clearly overlaps with named tuples, dataclasses, and objects in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, there's a special type hint for this kind of dictionary, called a `TypedDict`, that looks like a `NamedTuple` type hint. "

    "This second example can be confusing; how do we decide how to represent attribute values of an object? We can rank the techniques like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "1-) For a lot of cases, **dataclasses** offer a number of helpful features with less code writing. \n",
    "\n",
    "They can be immutable, or mutable, giving us a wide range of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-) For cases where the data is immutable, a **`NamedTuple`** can be slightly more efficient than a frozen dataclass by about 5% – not much. \n",
    "\n",
    "What tips the balance here is an expensive attribute computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "While a `NamedTuple` can have properties, if the computation is very costly and the results are used frequently, it can help to compute it in advance, something a `NamedTuple` isn't good at. \n",
    "\n",
    "3-) **Dictionaries** are ideal when the complete set of keys isn't known in advance. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we're starting a design, we may have throwaway prototypes or proofs of concept using dictionaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we try to write unit tests and type hints, we may need to ramp up the formality. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, the domain of possible keys is known, and a `TypedDict` type hint makes sense as a way to characterize the valid keys and value types. "

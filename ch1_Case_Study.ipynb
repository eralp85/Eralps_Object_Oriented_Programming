    "# CASE STUDY\n",
    "\n",
    "Our users want to automate a job often called classification. This is the underpinning idea behind product recommendations: last time, a customer bought product X, so perhaps they'd be interested in a similar product, Y. We've classified their desires and can locate other items in that class of products. This problem can involve complex data organization issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to start with something smaller and more manageable. The users eventually want to tackle complex consumer products, but recognize that solving a difficult problem is not a good way to learn how to build this kind of application. It's better to start with something of a manageable level of complexity and then refine and expand it until it does everything they need. In this case study, therefore, we'll be building a classifier for iris species. This is a classic problem, and there's a great deal written about approaches to classifying iris flowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to implement one popular approach called k-nearest neighbors, or k-NN for short. We require a training set of data, which the classifier algorithm uses as examples of correctly classified irises. Each training sample has a number of attributes, reduced to numeric scores, and a final, correct, classification (i.e. iris species). In this iris example, each training sample is an iris, with its attributes, such as petal shape, size, and so on, encoded into a numeric vector that is an overall representation of the iris, along with a correct species label for that iris.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an unknown sample, an iris whose species we want to know, we can measure the distance between the unknown sample and any of the known samples in the vector space. For some small group of nearby neighbors, we can take a vote. The unknown sample can be classified into the sub-population selected by the majority of the nearby neighbors.\n",

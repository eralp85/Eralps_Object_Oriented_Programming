    "An abstract base class is often generic with respect to some detail that is supplied by a concrete implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of Python's generic classes – classes like list, dict, and set – can be used as type hints, and these hints can be parameterized to narrow the domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a world of difference between `list[Any]` and `list[int]`; the value `[\"a\", 42, 3.14]` is valid for the first type hint, but invalid for the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "This concept of parameterizing the generic type to make it more specific often applies to abstract classes, also.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to work, you will often need to incorporate `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of your module.\n",

    "This is a new feature in Python 3.7 that allows you to use forward references in type hints.\n",

    "Generic classes and abstract classes are not the same thing. The two concepts overlap but are distinct.\n",

    "Generic classes have an implicit relationship with `Any`. This often needs to be narrowed using type parameters, like `list[int]`.\n",

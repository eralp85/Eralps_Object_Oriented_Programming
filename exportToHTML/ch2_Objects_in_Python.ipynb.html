</span><span class="s1"># INTRODUCING TYPE HINTS 
 
Objects are Pythonâ€™s abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects. 
 
Every object has an identity, a type and a value. 
 
The central idea here is that **everything in Python is an object**. 
 
Objects are instances of types (classes).In other words, every object is defined by being an instance of at least one class. 
 
So in fact, &quot;instance&quot; and &quot;object&quot; are two words for the same thing. 
 
Lists are objects. 42 is an object. Modules are objects. Functions are objects. Python bytecode is also kept in an object. 
 
When we write literal values like &quot;Hello, world!&quot; or 42, we're actually creating instances of built-in classes. 
 
We use the built-in type() function on the class that defines the properties of these objects: 
</span><span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">type(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">A variable is a referance to an object. Think of a yellow sticky note with a name on it stuck to an object. 
 
The type information is defined by the class associated with the object. 
 
The type information is not attached to the variable in any way.  
 
</span><span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">a_string_variable </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s2">&quot;Strng&quot;</span>
<span class="s1">type(a_string_variable)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">id(a_string_variable)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">hash(a_string_variable)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">a_string_variable </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s4">42</span>
<span class="s1">type(a_string_variable)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">id(a_string_variable)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">hash(a_string_variable)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">We created an object using a built-in class, str. We assigned a long name, a_string_variable, to the object.  
 
Then, we created an object using a different built-in class, int. We assigned this object the same name.  
 
(The previous string object has no more references and ceases to exist.) 
 
The various properties (type, id, hash) are part of the object, not the variable. 
 
**The variable is just a name that refers to an object**. 
</span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">## CREATING PYTHON CLASSES 
 
In the olden days, there was a difference between user-defined classes and built in types. But since Pytohn 2.2, there is no real difference.  
 
**Essentially, a class is a mechanism Python gives us to create new user-defined types from Python code**. 
 
Using the class mechanism, we've created Eralp - a user-defined type.  
 
m is an instance of the class Eralp. In other words, it's an object and its type is Eralp. 
</span><span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s5">class </span><span class="s1">Eralp</span><span class="s3">:</span>
    <span class="s5">pass</span>

<span class="s1">m </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s1">Eralp()</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">type(m)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% md 
</span>

<span class="s1">The class definition starts with the class keyword, followed by the name of the class and ends with a colon. 
 
Class names shall be written in CamelCase. 
 
Creating an instance of a class is a matter of typing the class name, followed by a pair of parentheses.  
 
It looks much like a function call; calling a class will create a new object. 
</span><span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s5">class </span><span class="s1">MyFirstClass</span><span class="s3">:</span>
    <span class="s5">pass</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">a </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s1">MyFirstClass()</span>
<span class="s1">b </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s1">MyFirstClass()</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">print(a)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">print(b)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">## ADDING ATTRIBUTES TO A CLASS 
 
We can set arbitrary attributes on an instantiated object using dot notation. 
</span><span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s5">class </span><span class="s1">Point</span><span class="s3">:</span>
    <span class="s5">pass</span>


<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">p1 </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s1">Point()</span>
<span class="s1">p2 </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s1">Point()</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">p1.x </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s4">5</span>
<span class="s1">p1.y </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s4">4</span>

<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">p2.x </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s4">3</span>
<span class="s1">p2.y </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s4">6</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">print(p1.x, p1.y)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">print(p2.x, p2.y)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">Above code creates an empty Point class with no data or behaviors. Then, it creates two instances of that class and assigns each of those instances x and y coordinates to identify a point in two dimensions.  
 
All we need to do to assign a value to an attribute on an object is use the &quot;&lt; object &gt;&quot;.&quot;&lt; attribute &gt;&quot; = &quot;&lt; value &gt;&quot; syntax.  
 
This is sometimes referred to as dot notation. 
</span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">## Making it Do Something 
 
Having objects with attributes is nice, but it's not very useful unless we can add some behaviors to those objects. 
 
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is really about the interactions between objects. 
 
We have the data (attributes). Now we need to add some behaviors (methods). 
 
Let's add a &quot;reset&quot; method to our Point class that will reset the coordinates to 0, 0. 
</span><span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s5">class </span><span class="s1">Point</span><span class="s3">:</span>
    <span class="s5">def </span><span class="s1">reset(self)</span><span class="s3">:</span>
        <span class="s1">self.x </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s4">0</span>
        <span class="s1">self.y </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s4">0</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">p </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s1">Point()</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">p.reset()</span>
<span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">print(p.x, p.y)</span>
<span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">In Python, a meyhod is formatted identically to a function.  
 
It starts with the def keyword, followed by the method name and a pair of parentheses containing any arguments (parameters). 
 
The difference between a function and a method is that methods have one required argument. 
 
**This argument is convebtionally called self**. 
 
</span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">The self argument to a method is a reference to the object that the method is being invoked on. 
 
The object is an instance of a class and this is sometimes called the instance variable. 
 
_We can think of the method as a function attached to a class._ 
 
_The **self** parameter refers to a specific instance of the class_ 
 
_When you call the method on two different objects, you are calling the same method twice but passing two different objects as the self parameter_
